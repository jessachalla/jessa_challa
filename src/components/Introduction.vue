        <span class="flair">Hey there! </span> I'm Jessa Challa. I'm a lifelong
        Grand Rapids resident and equity advocate. I'm Co-CEO and a Software
        Engineer at a minority and women-owned software company, Mallowfields
        LLC.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-p">
        I graduated from <span class="flair">Aquinas College</span> with a
        degree in Geography. My focus on geography and Geographic Information
        Systems (GIS) opened doors for impact in local government and the
        nonprofit sector including work with the Grand Valley Metro Council,
        Grand Rapids Public Museum, and the City of Grand Rapids Engineering
        Department and Parking Department.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-p">
        So how did I become a Software Engineer? Well my tech journey was
        non-traditional: in 2019, I completed a coding bootcamp at
        <span class="flair">Grand Circus</span>. Now, I teach free coding
        classes through Grand Circus, mentor and connect womxn and BIPOC
        individuals to opportunities in the tech sector, and maintain a high
        level of excellence within my field as a successful BIPOC woman in my
        field. I have the ultimate goal of making the tech sector a more
        inviting and inclusive place for all.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-p">
        And what about community work? Well, as a member of the 2020 Cohort of
        Community Catalysts through
        <span class="flair">WMCATâ€™s Public Agency</span>, I've utilized
        Equity-Centered Design to begin the work to challenge and change systems
        and institutions of power to be more equitable across Grand Rapids
        through strategic projects and initiatives. I also work on personal
        community project to create community resources.
